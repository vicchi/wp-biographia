Add and display a customizable author biography for all single post types (posts, pages, etc), in RSS feeds, in archives and on each entry on the landing page.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add a customizable biography to posts, to RSS feeds to pages, to archives and to each post on your blog's landing page. It integrates out of the box with the information that can be provided in each user's profile.

Settings and options include:

1. Choose when to display a Biography Box; on the front page, in archives, on individual posts, pages, or any other custom post type and in RSS feeds.
1. Choose the border style and background color of the Biography Box
1. Choose the amount of user profile information displayed in the Biography Box
1. Choose the gravatar image size
1. Choose to display the bio at the top or the bottom (universally)

The plugin also expands and enhances the Contact Info section of your user profile, adding support for Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Google+ profile links as well as Yahoo! Messenger, AIM, Windows Live Messenger and Jabber/Google Talk instant messaging profiles.

The plugin also has an added filter and shortcode ([wp_biographia]) to add further customization. For example, if you use page templates to display custom post types or your blog, you can simply use filter ('wp_biographia_pattern') to decide how you'd like to customize. Or, if you want the bios to appear at the bottom but on archive pages, you want them at the top, then the filter can do that as well. Or use the shortcode to control where it appears in a post of any post type.

= This plugin looks very much like the WP About Author; what's the connection? =

WP Biographia is inspired by and based on the WP About Author plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-about-author/) by Jon Bishop (http://www.jonbishop.com/). Thanks and kudos must go to Jon for writing a well structured, working WordPress plugin released under a software license that enables other plugins such as this one to be written or derived in the first place. Jon's written other WordPress plugins as well (http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/JonBishop/); you should take a look.

= I want to amend/hack/augment this plugin; can I do the same? =

Totally; like the original plugin by Jon, this plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 (GPLV2). See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt for the full license terms.

= Where does the name WP Biographia come from? =

WP Biographia is named after the etymology of the modern English word biography. The word first appeared in the 1680s, probably from the latin biographia which itself derived from the Greek bio, meaning "life" and graphia, meaning "record" or "account" which derived from graphein, "to write".
